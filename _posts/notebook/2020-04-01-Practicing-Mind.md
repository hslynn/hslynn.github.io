## From Chapter 'Perception Change Creats Patience!' 
* Speaking about what she was reading, she said, “You need to keep reviewing these ideas so that you can hang on to the clarity and perspective. Otherwise, life steals it away.”
* Experiencing impatience is one of the first symptoms of not being in the present moment, not doing what you are doing, and not staying process-oriented. I feel that staying in the present moment is one of the hardest lessons to learn.
* We need to let go of this futile idea that happiness is out there somewhere, and embrace the infinite growth available to us as a treasure, not something that we are impatient to overcome.
* There was a sense of freedom in knowing that I would never run out of room to grow. There was a peace in knowing the race was over. Where I was “right now” was just where I should be for the amount of effort I had expended.
* To change your perspective, you must first realize this truth, and secondly, you must become aware of when you are involved in the process of working toward a particular goal. When you make a decision to acquire something which will require a long-term commitment, pick the goal and then be aware you are entering the “process” of achieving the goal. You cannot do this if you are constantly making the end result your point of focus. You have acknowledged the goal, now let go of it and put your energy into the process of achieving the goal.
