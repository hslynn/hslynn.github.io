## From Chapter 'Perception Change Creats Patience!' 
* Speaking about what she was reading, she said, “You need to keep reviewing these ideas so that you can hang on to the clarity and perspective. Otherwise, life steals it away.”
* Experiencing impatience is one of the first symptoms of not being in the present moment, not doing what you are doing, and not staying process-oriented. I feel that staying in the present moment is one of the hardest lessons to learn.
* We need to let go of this futile idea that happiness is out there somewhere, and embrace the infinite growth available to us as a treasure, not something that we are impatient to overcome.
* There was a sense of freedom in knowing that I would never run out of room to grow. There was a peace in knowing the race was over. Where I was “right now” was just where I should be for the amount of effort I had expended.
* To change your perspective, you must first realize this truth, and secondly, you must become aware of when you are involved in the process of working toward a particular goal. When you make a decision to acquire something which will require a long-term commitment, pick the goal and then be aware you are entering the “process” of achieving the goal. You cannot do this if you are constantly making the end result your point of focus. You have acknowledged the goal, now let go of it and put your energy into the process of achieving the goal.

## From Chapter 'The Four 'S' Words'
* Simplify---化繁为简
* Small---化整为零
* Short---一次一跬步
* Slow---欲速则不达

## From Chapter 'Equanimity and DOC'
* Judgments are necessary to function in life, but they have a down side. The problem with the whole process of judging is that it is not executed with a detached nature. There is usually some emotion involved, and the amount of emotion is proportional to the perceived importance of the judgment.
* We must work at being more objectively aware of ourselves. We cannot refine any part of our daily thought processes if we are not separate from them.
* How do we become aligned to the Observer? How do we free ourselves from the confines of our ego? Though there are certainly a number of ways to accomplish this, in my opinion, the most effective method for creating this awareness spontaneously and effortlessly is meditation.
* ...“DOC,” which stands for Do, Observe, Correct.
* Don’t confuse judging something with evaluating something. Evaluating comes before the action of passing judgment. You can’t judge something if you haven’t first evaluated it. You can make the decision to stop the process after evaluating and before it gets to a judgment. That is what you are doing in DOC. Your observation is the point where you are evaluating your process. Are you heading toward your goal? Then you jump immediately to CORRECT and skip the judgment because it has no value in your effort.
    
## From Chapter 'Teach and Learn From Children'
* Look at an activity such as taking piano lessons. Children can’t see the point in practicing because they have no concept of being able to play well and the enjoyment that would bring to them. That is why they get impatient. Why do it? Adults, however, do possess an understanding of the point of practicing, and it is for the exact opposite reason. They do have a concept of what it would be like to play well and that is the very reason they get impatient. They can’t play well enough, soon enough. So as an adult, you have to notice that carefree nature that comes naturally to a child from living for and in the present. You have to try and help them to not “unlearn” that nature as they grow up in a world that constantly tries to push it out of them. 
* Children have so much to offer because we can learn from them if we listen to ourselves as we are teaching them.

## From Chapter 'Your Skills are Growing'
* When we are in the present moment, we experience life as it happens and as it really is, rather than through the filters of anticipation, as in the future; or through analyses, as in the past. Most of us spend very little time in the present moment. We usually are either thinking about something that has not yet happened (and may never happen), or reliving something that already has. We waste the opportunity to experience what is real on something that is not. 
* As you begin to use these techniques in different areas of your life, you will no doubt experience moments of frustration. This is, however, just the result of us holding imaginary ideals of how quickly we should master any new endeavor that we undertake. Again, we are taught this crippling mindset by almost every aspect of our culture, from the educational system with its grades, to the marketing media. 
* Most importantly, if we make our first item of business to develop our practicing mind, then the process of becoming is an adventure, and we are filled with peace instead of struggle.
